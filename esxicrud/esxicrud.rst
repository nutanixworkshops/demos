++++++++

A quick demo of creating and cloning a VM in Prism highlights ease of use and reinforces the concept of the hypervisor being a feature of the stack, not another datacenter silo that should require tremendous amounts of training to configure and maintain. It is a key part of making Nutanix an on-rem cloud experience.

This demo is performed from the Prism Central interface.
